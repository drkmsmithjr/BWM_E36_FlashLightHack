# BWM_E36_FlashLightHack
Kicad Schematic of the BWM M3 E36 Glovebox Flash Light 

My BMW M3 E36 Glovebox Flashlight has not worked for years, so I decided to do a teardown and repair.    BWM is the only Car manufacturer that I know that puts a flashlight in the glove box.  It is a nice idea, but the simple design guarantees that it will need replacement in 6-10 years.    When do you ever need a flashlight in the car?   However, when you do, you probably want it to work.   In this post, I'll show the teardown, the circuit description, how I repaired it and put it back together.
